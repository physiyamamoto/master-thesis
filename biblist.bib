@article{edwards,
	Abstract = {A new theory of the class of dilute magnetic alloys, called the spin glasses, is proposed which offers a simple explanation of the cusp found experimentally in the susceptibility. The argument is that because the interaction between the spins dissolved in the matrix oscillates in sign according to distance, there will be no mean ferro- or antiferromagnetism, but there will be a ground state with the spins aligned in definite directions, even if these directions appear to be at random. At the critical temperature the existence of these preferred directions affects the orientation of the spins, leading to a cusp in the susceptibility. This cusp is smoothed by an external field. Although the behaviour at low t needs a quantum mechanical treatment, it is interesting to complete the classical calculations down to t=0. Classically the susceptibility tends to a constant value at t=0, and the specific heat to a constant value.},

	Abstract = {A cumulant expansion is used to calculate the transition temperature of Ising models with random-bond defects. For a concentration, x, of missing interactions in the simple-square Ising model the author finds -T c -1 dT c /dx mod x=0 =1.329 compared with the mean-field value of one. If the interactions are independent random variable with a width delta J/J identical to epsilon , the result is -T c -1 dT c /d epsilon 2 mod epsilon =0 =0.312 compared with the mean-field results of zero. An approximation yields the specific heat in the critical regime as C approximately C 0 /(1+x gamma 2 C 0 ), where gamma is a constant and C 0 is the unperturbed specific heat at a renormalized temperature. Thus, the specific heat divergence is broadened over a temperature interval Delta T, with Delta T/T c approximately x (1 alpha )/, where alpha is the critical exponent for the specific heat, and a maximum value of order x -1 is attained. Heuristic arguments show that this smoothing effect occurs if alpha >0.},
